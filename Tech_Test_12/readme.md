Looking for: General programming, succinctness

Time allocation: Approximately 30 minutes

Notes: If you are not familiar with Node.js feel free to answer using JavaScript in a browser environment and adapt the specification to this environment to the best of your ability.

Write a script that will be executed from the command line.

The script should echo the numbers 1 to 500 except in the following cases:

1. If the number is a prime echo: 'FiZZBUZZ++'
2. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 the script should echo: 'FIZZBUZZ'
3. If the number is divisible by 3 the script should echo: 'FIZZ'
4. If the number is divisible by 5 the script should echo: 'BUZZ'

-   Each output should be on a new line.
-   The script should also log the above output to a file called fizzbuzz.log.
-   Data that may already be in the fizzbuzz.log file should not be overwritten.
