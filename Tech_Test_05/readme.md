# Rubikâ€™s Cube 
Represent a 3x3 Rubik's Cube in a Program 

If you don't know what a Rubik's Cube is, then a quick Google should let you know. 

This question is aimed at seeing how you would approach a non-trivial problem before you would start to implement a solution - perhaps what you would do at the whiteboard. 
The problem is how might you represent a Rubik's Cube in a program such that you can query the state of the cube (i.e. what colours are where) and perform rotations on the cube mixing colours up appropriately. 

The things we would like you to consider are: 
* the data structure(s) representing the cube and its parts 
* how to perform rotations on those data structures 
* how you could test your proposed solution 

You do not need to create a working program or prove that your solution works, but you must be able to say how you came up with it and why you think it would work. 

The problem has nothing to do with how you might solve a Rubik's Cube so don't worry about that. 

Please send us an outline of your solution before interview.
