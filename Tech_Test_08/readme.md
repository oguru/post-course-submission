// Two numbers, comma delimited, returns the sum
// Two numbers, newline delimited, returns the sum
// Three numbers, delimited either way, returns the sum
// Negative numbers throw an exception
// Numbers greater than 1000 are ignored
// A single char delimiter can be defined on the first line (e.g. //# for a ‘#’ as the delimiter)
// A multi char delimiter can be defined on the first line (e.g. //[###] for ‘###’ as the delimiter)
// Many single or multi-char delimiters can be defined (each wrapped in square brackets)
