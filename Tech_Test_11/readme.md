# Shapes (Node.js / JavaScript)

Looking for: Design patterns, package design, defensive and general programming

Time allocation: Approximately 35 minutes

Write a JavaScript module with the following API:

1. calcVolumeCylinder - Calculates the volume of a cylinder
2. calcVolumeCuboid - Calculates the volume of a cuboid
3. calcVolumeSphere - Calculates the volume of a sphere

The solution should defend against invalid inputs and fail gracefully.

Demonstrate your module in use in another file.
